# Registers, Counters, and the Brainless CPU

This repository provides exercises and implementations of registers, counters, and a simple CPU design without control logic. It demonstrates how basic digital circuits function in computing systems.

### Features:
- Design of registers and counters.
- Simple CPU implementation.

This project helps users understand how basic digital components are used in CPU design.
